## funi (format-unifier)

The aim of the project is to parse multiple files 
and create a unified data structure for them.

### Task

> You are tasked to create a script that will parse multiple csv's 
> and create a unified csv. There are 3 different csv's, this will increase 
> in the future. The client has as hard requirement that the result 
> is stored as csv file. But json and xml will be used in the future, 
> maybe even storing the result in a database.

> In the data folder there are 3 csv's with banking data. 
> Since the csv's come from different banks the layout of data can differ. 
> The bank statements have data from the month October.
